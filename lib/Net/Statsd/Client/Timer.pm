=head1 NAME

Net::Statsd::Client::Timer - Measure event timings and send them to StatsD

=head1 VERSION

version 0.20

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Statsd::Client;
    my $stats = Net::Statsd::Client->new(prefix => "service.frobnitzer.");

    my $timer = $stats->timer("request_duration");
    # ... do something expensive ...
    $timer->finish;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Net::Statsd::Client::Timer->new(...)

To build a timer object, call L<Net::Statsd::Client>'s C<timer> method,
instead of calling this constructor directly.

A timer has an associated statsd object, metric name, and sample rate, and
begins counting as soon as it's constructed.

=head2 $timer->finish

Stop timing, and send the elapsed time to the server.

=head2 $timer->cancel

Stop timing, but do not send the elapsed time to the server. A timer that
goes out of scope without having C<finish> or C<cancel> called on it will
generate a warning, since this probably points to bugs and lost timing
information.

=head2 $timer->metric($new)

Change the metric name of a timer on the fly. This is useful if you don't
know what kind of event you're timing until it's finished. Harebrained
example:

    my $timer = $statsd->timer("item.fetch");
    my $item = $cache->get("blah");
    if ($item) {
        $timer->metric("item.fetch_from_cache");
    } else {
        $item = get_it_the_long_way();
    }
    $timer->finish;
