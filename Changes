  * BUG FIX: 0.30 would send sampled timers using an incorrect format.

0.30      2013-09-19 20:38:23 EST5EDT
  * Add 'gauge' and 'set_add' methods to support statsd gauges and sets.

0.22      2013-07-06 14:41:13 EST5EDT
  * Depend on Etsy::StatsD 1.001. This fixes a bug which would sometimes
    cause corrupted partial metrics to be sent (thanks Ricardo Signes and
    Steve Sanbeg).
  * Fix tests to pass with Etsy::StatsD 1.001.

0.21      2013-06-13 17:48:49 America/New_York
  * Allow setting a callback that will be used to emit a warning when a
    timer is destroyed unexpectedly. Idea courtesy of rjbs.

0.20      2013-06-12 17:15:47 America/New_York
  * Use Moo. This makes the code a little more manageable and has a
    negligible impact on speed.
  * Don't run failure-prone "live" tests on install or CPANtesters, add a
    set of non-live tests.
  * Add the ability to re-target the metric of a timer between starting and
    finishing it.

0.11      2013-06-03 15:28:30 America/New_York
  * Make timers report their times in ms like they should
